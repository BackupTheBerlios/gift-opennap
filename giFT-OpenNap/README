giFT OpenNap
============

giFT OpenNap is a OpenNap plugin for giFT, though it's not limited
to OpenNap servers ;)

The latest version can be found at
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gift-opennap
currently.


Status
======

Searching works, downloading and uploading stuff is on it's way.

It's known to work on:
 * Linux 2.4 on x86
 * MacOS X 10.2 on PPC

If you get it working on another system, please let me know.
If you don't get it working on another system, let me know as well :)


Installation
============

Just run the usual commands:

  ./autogen.sh
  make
  make install

If it doesn't compile, update the code from CVS and update giFT, then
try again.

You'll also need to tell giFT you'd like to use this plugin:
Open ~/.giFT/gift.conf and add "OpenNap" to the line that starts with
plugins = ...


Configuration
=============

See ~/.giFT/OpenNap/OpenNap.conf - it's quite well documented.
If you're just getting started, the defaults will work well for you.

If you want to use giFT OpenNap with a local server, put some IPs
in ~/.giFT/OpenNap/nodelist. Have a look at
/usr/local/share/giFT/OpenNap/nodelist (path will vary if you didn't
install giFT-OpenNap to /usr/local) to see how it should look like.


Contact
=======

I can be reached via e-mail (see AUTHORS) or via the gift-opennap-devel
mailing list (http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gift-opennap).
Feel free to send patches or bugreports.

giFT OpenNap
============

giFT OpenNap is a OpenNap plugin for giFT, though it's not limited
to OpenNap servers ;)

The latest version can be found at
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gift-opennap
currently.

Status
======

Searching works, downloading is on it's way, but uploading stuff
doesn't work yet.

It's known to work on:
Linux 2.4 on x86

If you get it working on another system, please let me know.
If you don't get it working on another system, let me know as well :)

Installation
============

Just run the usual commands:

  ./autogen.sh
  make
  make install

You'll also need to tell giFT you'd like to use this plugin:
Open ~/.giFT/gift.conf and add "OpenNap" to the line that starts with
plugins = ...

Configuration
=============

See ~/.giFT/OpenNap/OpenNap.conf - it's quite well documented.
If you're just getting started, the defaults will work well for you.

If you want to use giFT OpenNap with a local server, enable
local mode and put some IPs in ~/.giFT/OpenNap/nodelist.

Contact
=======

I can be reached via e-mail (see AUTHORS) or via the gift-opennap-devel

giFT OpenNap
============

giFT OpenNap is a OpenNap plugin for giFT, though it's not limited
to OpenNap servers ;)

The latest version can be found at
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gift-opennap
currently.

Status
======

Searching works, sharing and downloading (or uploading) stuff doesn't.

It's known to work on:
Linux 2.4 on x86

If you get it working on another system, please let me know.
If you don't get it working on another system, let me know as well :)

Installation
============

Just run the usual commands:

  ./autogen.sh
  make
  make install

You'll also need to tell giFT you'd like to use this plugin:
Open ~/.giFT/gift.conf and add "OpenNap" to the line that starts with
plugins = ...
